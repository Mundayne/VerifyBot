VerifyBot

How to install on windows.
This is fairly simple just install the newest version of nodejs. https://nodejs.org/en/ Then you want to click on the install.bat to install the required dependancies. Finally put your token in the config file. You can now click the run.bat to run the bot. To add it to your server use this link. https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=INSERT_CLIENT_ID_HERE&scope=bot&permissions=68610 
However you will have to replace the INSERT_CLIENT_ID_HERE with your client id from the discord apps page.
